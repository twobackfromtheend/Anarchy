# Anarchy

Anarchy is a Rocket League bot for the RLBot framework with one twist - anyone can edit it. Anyone can make a pull request to change Anarchy's code, and it will get accepted.

@AnarchyHelper is the GitHub bot that oversees all pull requests. It will accept any pull request as long as you don't exceed your line allowance.

You are allowed a maximum of 50 lines of additions and deletions each. You get 25 lines of additions and deletions each added to your allowance every 12 hours.

Have fun with Anarchy! Don't break it! :)
